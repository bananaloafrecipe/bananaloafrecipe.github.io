                    <h5>The Loaf Tin</h5>
<p>When you make a loaf cake, the first investment you need to make is in a loaf tin. Loaf tins tend to come in two main sizes - the 1lb tin and the 2lb tin. A reasonable size of loaf cake is a 2lb loaf - quite frankly a 1lb loaf is hardly much bigger than your hand and won't serve many people! Our recipe here uses a 2lb loaf tin.</P>
<p>There are many loaf tins on the market but for the baking on this website we have used the John Lewis 2lb tin which you can see here.</p>
<p>This tin ticks all the boxes for us which include:
  <ul>
    <li>non-stick</li>
    <li>heavy gauge metal - you don't want it warping in the oven</li>
    <li>edges to hold onto - with oven gloves on, you don't want it to slip out of your hands</li>
    <li>UK-made from UK steel</li>
    <li>Dishwasher safe - though to be honest, it's non-stick surface is so good we haven't needed to put it in the dishwasher yet</li>
    <li>it's a fairly standard size (SIZE????) - helpful for buying liners (see below)</li>
    <li>5 year guarantee</li>
  </ul>

<p>The tin is embossed with the word LOAF on the side. We were a bit dubious about this initially but it hasn't made any difference to the flavour of our cakes!</P>


 <h5>Loaf Tin Liners</h5>

<p>Lining a loaf tin with greaseproof paper certainly makes the washing up easier. It is said that the paper also stops the cooling bread or cake from drying out.  But even better than lining your tin with paper, we like to use loaf tin liners. These are pre-shaped paper liners that are designed to fit standard sized 1lb and 2lb loaf tins. If you're going to make even a few loaf cakes, breads or even meat loafs in your life, we highly recommend getting them. Click here to see the ones available in John Lewis.</P>

<h5>Cooling Rack</h5>
<p>When you take your cake out of the oven, you want it to cool evenly all over. Leaving it in the tin will cause condensation to quickly build up at the bottom of the tin and the base of the cake will go soggy. So you want it out of the tin as quickly as possible. But putting it on a plate will still cause the underside to get soggy. A cooling rack allows air to get to all of your cake and it will then cool evenly without any moisture build-up. </p>

<p>Cooling racks can come in all shapes and sizes, but we have found particular success with the non-stick variety. You need to have one that is a reasonable size to fit a dozen fairy cakes on or a couple of sponge cakes. About 40cm x 25cm (16 x 10 inches) is about right.</p>

<p>We particularly like the one in John Lewis which is even dishwasher safe - though we’ve never needed to put it in the dishwasher as we generally find that cakes lift off so easily that a quick wipe does the job.</p>
<h5>Cake tins</h5>
<p>What better way to show off your home baking than with some colourful cake tins. Over the years we’ve gone through a few in our house but one thing we often find is that they rust easily, particularly if left on the draining board to dry rather than being dried up immediately. The outsides seem to look fine but the inside silver surface develops ugly black spots that don’t look pretty.</p>
<p>Enter the Tala baking tins. We’ve had these tins for several years now and not treated them in any special way but, for some reason, their brass-coloured interior surfaces haven’t developed rust spots in the same way and they look as good as they did the day they were bought. The three tins are good sizes, they stack inside each other for maximum space saving and we really like the colours. </p>
